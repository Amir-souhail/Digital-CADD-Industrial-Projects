# DC Motor Assembly (SOLIDWORKS 2025)

This project contains a complete 3D model of a **DC Motor Assembly** designed using **SOLIDWORKS 2025**. It includes all component files, an exploded view, a motion simulation, and a Bill of Materials.

## 🧠 What is a DC Motor?

A **DC (Direct Current) motor** is an electromechanical device that converts electrical energy into mechanical rotational motion. It operates on the principle of Lorentz force: when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a force.

DC motors are widely used in robotics, small machinery, toys, and mechatronic systems due to their simplicity and controllability.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Current** flows through the motor windings (armature).
2. This creates an **electromagnetic field**.
3. The field interacts with the **permanent magnets** or stator field, producing **torque** on the rotor.
4. The **commutator** and **brushes** reverse the current at the correct time to maintain continuous rotation.

## 🧩 Components and Their Roles

| Part        | Role                                                                 |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rotor Housing (Part1) | Encases the rotating shaft and supports alignment            |
| Back Cover (Part4)     | Seals the motor casing and often holds the rear bearing     |
| Main Housing (Part5)   | Outer frame that supports the stator and entire structure   |
| Brushes (Part6)        | Conduct current to the rotating commutator (not visible)    |
| Spacer (Part7)         | Maintains precise spacing between internal components       |
| Bushing 1 (Part8)      | Supports smooth shaft rotation at one end                   |
| Bushing 2 (Part9)      | Additional shaft support and alignment                      |
| Armature Core (Part10) | Rotating part with coils; produces torque                   |
| Spur Gear              | Transfers torque from motor shaft to load                   |
